    Hi, I'm Dustin Toff. I'm a software developer currently working on a new, unreleased AWS service.

    I enjoy working on side projects in my spare time. Some of my more interesting projects include a compression program that uses math to calculate the original file, a programming game written in JavaScript where you program robots to gather resources, fight, and build other robots autonomously, and a CSS compiler that runs in JavaScript client side.
